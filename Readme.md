These are a set of notes for the Trinity College Dublin's Discrete Mathematics module. They are not my own, and were just converted from handwritten format.

About the module from the course handbook:

> This module provides students with an introduction to Discrete Mathematics. Students are exposed to diverse course material presented in the formal style and language that is commonplace in contemporary mathematics, with the aim that they should develop the skills required to engage effectively with such material. Students get an introduction to a variety of topics arising from Calculus, Geometry and Discrete Mathematics, that are of relevance in fields such as acoustics, image processing, computer graphics and cryptology.
